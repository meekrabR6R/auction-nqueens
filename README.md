Auction Lib
======

A simple back end auction library built with Scala. I know the instructions said to assume a key/value store lib,
but I thought it would be fun to go ahead and actually use one. I used casbah and mongodb (until now, my only
mongo experience was with Node.js. so it seemed like a good opportunity to learn a Scala based lib for it).

The auction library can be found in /src/main/scala/Auction.scala. AuctionStore.scala houses a singleton for interacting
with casbah/mongo.

Tests are in /src/test/scala/AuctionSpec.scala.

The solution can be found in /src/main/scala/EightQueen.scala
